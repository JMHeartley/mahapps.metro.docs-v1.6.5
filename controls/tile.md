The `Tile` is exactly as it sounds. It is a rectangular control whose sole purpose is to mimick a tile from Window 8/WinRT's Start Screen.

### How to use the `Tile`

The following XAML will initialize a `Tile` control with its `Title` set to `"Hello!"` and its `Count` set to `1`.

```xml
<controls:Tile Title="Hello!" 
               Width="100"
               Height="100" 
               Count="1" />
```
