### Metro isn't for everything

Microsoft have demonstrated both sides of metro - it can look absolutely stunning if it is done well, or absolutely woeful if done poorly. Not *every* application translates well into a metro interface. If you're designing a complex *tool* such as Visual Studio, it's probably best to avoid a heavy-typography based UI style.

Of course, there will always be exceptions to the rule, but just because metro *looks* simplistic does not mean the design isn't complex. The more complex an application, the more time (generally) you'll need to spend on the design. 

### No UI kit does design for you

While MahApps.Metro strives to make *good looking* metro interfaces easier, but just like with Windows Form or "default" WPF, a designer (or at least thinking about design) is needed to create a *good* interface. This is a combination of aesthetic and usability.

### Fonts

Segoe UI, Segoe WP and Zegoe UI are all Microsoft/Ascender fonts. They will not be embedded in MahApps.Metro.

### Interoperability

In order to maintain compatibility for both .NET 4.0 and 4.5, we make use of the Microsoft.Windows.Shell in the former.

### Other cool stuff
