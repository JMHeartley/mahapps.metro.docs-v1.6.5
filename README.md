Being limited to .NET Framework 4.0, I needed the documentation for MahApps.Metro v1.6.5 but I was unable to get it from the package's doc site.

So I forked the old site and hosted it here. I did no work here except for the few edits required for hosting on GitPages.

Please check out [this repo](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for the current package version and documentation.
